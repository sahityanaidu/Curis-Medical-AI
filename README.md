# Curis-Medical-AI
Curis is a Streamlit AI platform with LLMs and an integrated robotic assistant for medical injury analysis. Upload injury images for automated diagnostics, treatment recommendations, and reports. The robot delivers real-time guidance and vocalizes insights. Powered by CrewAI, LangChain &amp; Google Generative A, Curis lets clinicians and researchers:

- **Injury Analysis:** Upload injury photos for image-based feature extraction, LLM-driven interpretation, and real-time feedback from the onboard robot.  
- **Treatment Recommendations:** Receive contextual drug prescriptions and care plans, which the robot can vocalize or display on its screen.  
- **Report Generation:** Produce polished, exportable PDFs summarizing findings, next steps, and robotic-guided instructions.
